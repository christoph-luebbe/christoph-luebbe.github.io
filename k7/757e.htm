  </div>

  <div class="c3">
    <p>The oldest and most primitive way to determine a definite integral, 
    i.e. to calculate the area "under" a function "over" 
    an interval, is of course to draw the integrand onto graph paper and then 
    count the squares.</p>

    <p>With today's electronic calculators we can do this more elegantly 
	and much faster,&nbsp;by considering the defining limit and summing up the 
    areas of the strips after the dissection of the interval. In 
    doing so, the fewer strips and steps of iteration are needed, the closer we fit 
    the upper edge of the strip to the actual function to be integrated.</p>

    <p>The simplest choice are the horizontal straight lines as we have done in the definition, so 
    that the&nbsp;strips become rectangles, whose areas are easy to calculate. 
	Instead of the nodes

    in the interior of the partial intervals just as with the Riemann sum,&nbsp;we 
	can also take the minima and maxima of the 
    function in the partial intervals. Then we obtain an under and over sum, which enclose the integral in 
	the limit.</p>

    <p>The next elegant method is the&nbsp;<b>chord-trapezium rule</b>, by 
    which the function in each partial interval is approximated through the secant, 
    and the real areas of the stripes through the areas of trapezia.&nbsp; For 
    each partial interval we take instead of<img src="k7/gif/f75701.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="67" height="24" />:</p>

    </div><br />
    An even better approximation gives the <b>Simpson rule</b>, in which 
    the integrand function in the partial intervals is approximated through a 
	parabola according to <b>Kepler's barrel rule</b>. Here the 
    function is taken at three points in each strip:<p>&nbsp;</p>

    To find even more sophisticated rules through which the desired integral with 
	a pre-given demand for accuracy can be calculated in the fewest number of steps 
	is one of the 
    tasks of numerical mathematics.</div>
