    <h2>7 Integration</h2>

  <div class="c3">
    <p>The second main pillar in mathematical methods for all natural sciences is 
    the integral calculus. In some sense  integration is the inverse of&nbsp;differentiation. 
    While differentiation assigns to a function<img src="eq/fvx.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="31" height="24" />its gradient<img src="eq/fsvx.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="34" height="26" />, 
    the integral calculus deals with problems in which something is known 
    about the gradient of a function and other functions having this gradient are 
    sought. This assignment is much more difficult than differentiation, 
    it has however a central meaning for natural science.&nbsp; It turns out 
	that the basic laws of mechanics,&nbsp;electrodynamics and quantum mechanics can 
	be formulated as <em>differential equations</em> 
    which make statements about the derivatives of functions. For example, 
    Newton's second law makes a statement about the&nbsp;path or trajectory<img src="k7/gif/f70001.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="26" height="24" />of a&nbsp; particle under the influence of a force K, and 
	makes this statement using the second derivative of <img src="k7/gif/f70001.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="26" height="24" />, 
	i.e. the&nbsp; acceleration:</p>

    </div>
    

    <p>For a given force, e.g. gravity or the electric or magnetic force, a&nbsp;particle 
	trajectory is to be determined. To integrate in this context means&nbsp;to solve the basic 
    equations, applying the theory to the various cases which are encountered in practice.</p>

    <p>In previous chapters you have learned and practiced the technique of 
    differentiation. It is actually not that difficult, if you follow some 
    rules. Integration however is an <b>&quot;art&quot;</b>, as you will soon see. 
    However, since&nbsp;no artist ever appeared out of nowhere, but rather 
    had to develop his talent through learning, gaining experience 
    and practice, the same goes for integration. The following chapters 
    will give you plenty of opportunity to do this.</p>
