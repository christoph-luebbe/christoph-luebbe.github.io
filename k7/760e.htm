    <p>All that we have learned about integration is still not enough for 
    physicists. There are two further conditions to which they need answers:</p>

    <p>Firstly the <em>finite interval</em>, since in physics we often have 
    to integrate up to infinity, and secondly the <em>bounded&nbsp; integrand</em>, 
    because the integrands of physicists sometimes become infinite within 
    the integration interval, and often that is the place where something 
    interesting happens. Here, we would just like to indicate the considerations with 
    which both of these challenges can be overcome by adding one further&nbsp;limit:</p>
