    <p>Before we go on to calculate further integrals, we want to get to know the 
    most important properties of the derived integral&nbsp;concepts, and 
    put them together. Also we want to free ourselves from some of the preconditions 
    which until now we have accepted out of sheer idleness:</p>

    <p>But first let us emphasize that the denotation of the integration variable

    is of course 
    completely arbitrary: we also could have named it&nbsp;
