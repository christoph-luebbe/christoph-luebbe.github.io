    <p>In our first enthusiasm for the consequences of the&nbsp;Fundamental Theorem for 
    integration, by reading the differentiation table backwards, we have 
    slightly overrated our success. Because upon closer inspection, we see that there are 
    only relatively few functions, that occur in the second&nbsp;column of our <a href="#743b1e" >TABLE</a>. 
    Even such simple functions out of our basic set as<img src="k7/gif/f75105.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="95" height="28" /> 
    cannot be found. All the more 
    <img src="k7/gif/f75106.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="124" height="30" />is 
	nowhere to be found, although we can easily integrate the reciprocal of 
    this root. Also with the Gaussian bell-shaped&nbsp; 
    <img src="k7/gif/f75107.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="116" height="28" /> 
    we are pretty helpless with out TABLE.</p>

    <p>Differently as in differentiation there is no procedure of integration 
	which automatically after a sufficient amount of work leads to the goal. 
    This is the reason why <em>integration is an art
	<span style="font-weight: 400">while differentiation can be called 
	atechnique</span></em>.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, there are a lot of rules and tricks which follow 
    from the characteristics of the integral and can make our lives considerably 
	easier. Therefore we want to turn out attention now to those: the simplest one is the&nbsp; <a href="#752e">
    linear decomposition</a>.</p>
