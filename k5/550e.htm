    <p>Now we can start looking at examples, applying the general definition to 
	specific functions which will lead us to the rules according to which the 
	technique of differentiation works. We shall calculate the differential quotients of all important 
	elementary functions and put 
    them all together clearly in a&nbsp; <em>TABLE </em>&nbsp;which will be of 
    unexpected value for us later on.</p>
