		<span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">It is hardly an 
		overstatement to claim that 
		theoretical physics began with the concept of differentiation. The development of this 
		 
		branch of mathematics by Leibniz and Newton in the 17<sup>th</sup> 
		century made possible the formulation of the exact laws describing a 
		wide range of very important physical phenomena: Newton&#8217;s laws of 
		mechanics, the Maxwell equations&nbsp;for electrodynamics and the Schr√∂dinger 
		equation of quantum mechanics are all expressed in the language of 
		differential equations.</span><p>
		<span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">The solutions 
		of these require the entire apparatus of analysis, especially of the 
		differential and integral calculus. For this reason the present chapter is of the utmost importance to us. Differentiation and 
		integration are indispensable tools of every physicist.</span></div>
