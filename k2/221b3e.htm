  <p class="c1">Counter-examples:</p>

  <p>As an example of a linkage that leads out of a set, we will soon deal with 
  the well known <a href="#9511')">sc</a><a href="#9511e">alar 
  product</a> of two vectors, which combines their components into a simple number.</p>

  <p>Non-communicative are for example the rotations of the match box shown in <a href="#221b5e" >
  Figure 9.10</a> 
  in a Cartesian coordinate system: First turn it clockwise around the 
  longitudinal symmetry axis parallel to the 3-axis and then around the shortest 
  transversal axis parallel to the 1-axis and compare the result with the 
  position of the box after you have performed the two rotations in the reversed&nbsp;order!</p>

  <p>Counter-examples of the bracket law for three elements of a set are 
  very hard to find: From the home chemistry sector we remember the three 
  ingredients for  non-fat whipped cream for children: ( sugar + egg-white ) + 
  juice = cream. If you try to whip first the egg-white together with juice as 
  suggested by the instruction: sugar + (egg-white + juice) you will never get 
  the cream whipped.</p>
