  <p>Later on you will learn that groups play a very important role in the 
	search for symmetries in physics, e.g. for crystals or the classification of 
	elementary particles. The elements of a group are often operations, like e.g. 
  rotations: the result of two rotations performed one after the other can also 
  be reached by one single rotation. In performing three rotations the result 
  does not depend on the brackets. The operation <em>no rotation</em> leaves the 
  body unchanged. Each rotation can be cancelled. </p>

  <p>Usually these groups are not Abelian, e.g. two rotations performed in 
  different order yield different results. Therefore mathematicians did not 
  incorporate the Commutative Law into the properties of groups. The more 
	specialized commutative groups are given the name Abelian after the 
  Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829).</p>
