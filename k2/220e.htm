    <p>In order to display our measured data we need the numbers which you have 
    been 
    familiar with for a long time. In order to get an overview, we shall put 
     
    together here their properties as a reminder. In addition we recall some selected 
    concepts which mathematicians have 
     
    formulated  as rules for the combination of numbers, so that we can later 
    on compare those rules with the ones for more complicated mathematical 
    quantities.</p>
