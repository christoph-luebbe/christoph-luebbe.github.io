    <p>The laws of numbers and their linkages are the main objects of mathematics. 
    Although numbers have developed from basic needs of human social interaction, 
    and natural science has inspired mathematics again and again, e.g. for 
    differential and integral calculus, mathematics actually does not  belong to 
    natural sciences, but rather to humanities. Mathematics does not start from empirical 
	(i.e. measured) facts. 
    Instead, it investigates the logical structure of numbers and their generalizations 
    within the human ability of thought. In many cases empirical facts can 
    be well represented in terms of these logical structures. In this way mathematics 
	became an indispensable tool for natural scientists and engineers.</p>
