  <p class="c1">History:</p>

  <p>Already in  antiquity some mathematicians knew that there 
  are numbers which cannot be represented as fractions. They showed this with 
  a so-called indirect proof:</p>

  <p>If e.g. the diagonal of a&nbsp; square with side length 
  <img src="eq/1.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="6" height="11" /> 
  were a rational number, like 
  <img src="k2/gif/f22406.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="64" height="29" />, 
   
  two natural numbers<img src="k2/gif/f22407.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="54" height="24" />would 
	exist 
  with 
  <img src="k2/gif/f22408.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="58" height="15" />. 
  Think now of the prime factor decompositions of 
  <img src="eq/b.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="7" height="13" /> 
  and 
  <img src="eq/a.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="8" height="9" />. 
	On the left hand side of the equation there stands an even number of these 
  factors, because of the square each factor appears twice. On the right hand 
  side, however, an odd number of factors shows up, because in addition the factor 2 appears. Since the prime factor decomposition is unique, the equation cannot 
  be right.</p>

  <p>With this it is shown that the assumption,<img src="k2/gif/f22409.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="20" height="29" /> 
  can be represented as a fraction, leads to a contradiction and thus must be 
  wrong.</p>
