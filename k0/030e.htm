    <h3>From Knowledge to Skill</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="justifiedText">
    <p>This course is intended to ease the <em>transition from school studies 
	to university studies</em>. It 
    is intended to diminish or compensate for the sometimes pronounced 
	differences in mathematical preparation among incoming students, resulting 
	from the differing standards of schools, courses and teachers. Forgotten and submerged 
    material shall be recalled and repeated, scattered knowledge collected and 
	organized, known material&nbsp; reformulated, with the goal of developing <em>
    common mathematical&nbsp; foundations. </em>No new mathematics 
    is offered here, 
    at any rate nothing that is not presented elsewhere, perhaps even 
    in a more detailed, more exact or more beautiful form.</p>

    <p>The main features of this course to emphasize are its selection of material, 
	its compact 
	presentation and modern format. Most of the material of an advanced 
	mathematics school course is selected less for the development of practical 
	math skills, and more for the purpose of intellectual training in logic and axiomatic theory. 
	Here we shall organize much of the same material in a way appropriate&nbsp;for university studies, in some places supplementing 
    and extending it a little.</p>

    <p>It is well-known, that in the natural sciences you need to know 
    mathematical terms and operations. You must also be able to work effectively 
	with them. For this reason the many <em>exercises</em>&nbsp;are 
    particularly important, because they allow you  to determine your own 
	location in the crucial transition region <em>&quot;from knowledge to 
	technique&quot;</em>. We shall  especially stress practical aspects, even if thereby sometimes the 
    mathematical sharpness (and possibly also the elegance) is diminished. 
    This online course is not a replacement for mathematical lectures. It can, however, 
	be a good preparation for these as well.</p>

    <p>Repeating and training basic knowledge must start as early as 
    possible, before gaps in this knowledge begin to impede the understanding of the basic 
    lectures, and psychological barriers can develop. Therefore in Heidelberg the 
    physics faculty has offered to physics beginners, since many years during the 
    two weeks <em>prior to</em> the start of the first lectures, a crash course 
	in form of an all-day block course. I have given this course several times 
	since 
	84/85, with listeners also from other natural sciences and mathematics. We can well 
    imagine that this course can make the beginning considerably easier for engineering students 
	as well. In Heidelberg the online version shall by no means 
    replace the proven crash courses for the beginners prior to their first 
    semester. But it will usefully support and augment these courses. And perhaps it will 
    help incoming students with their preparation, and later with solidifying their 
	understanding of the material. This need might be especially acute for 
	students beginning in summer semester, in particular when Easter holiday is 
	unusually late. Over years this course may also help serve to standardize the material.</p>

    <p>This electronic form of the course, free of charge available on the net, 
	seems ideally suited 
	for use during the relaxation time between school graduation and the beginning of lectures at university. A 
	thoughtful student will have time to prepare, to cushion&nbsp;the unfortunately still frequent small shock 
	of the 
    first lectures, if not to avoid it altogether. It 
    seems to us appropriate and meaningful to present this electronic form of the 
    course&nbsp; (which is accessible to you always, and not only two weeks before the semester), to 
	augment and deepen the treatment beyond what is normally possible in our 
	block courses in intensive contact with the Heidelberg beginner students. Furthermore we 
	have often noticed in practice that 
    small excursions in &quot;higher mathematics&quot;, historical reviews and  
    physical applications beyond school knowledge energize and awaken 
    a desire to learn more about what is coming. I shall therefore also  address here some &quot;higher 
    things&quot;, especially toward the ends of the chapters. I will put these 
	topics however 
    in small or larger <em>inserts</em> or special exercises, so that they can 
    be passed over without hesitation.</p>

    <p>As you have seen from the <em>quotation</em> at the beginning from 
    Goethe's (1749-1832) Faust we have to deal with an old problem. But <em>you </em>are now 
	in the fortunate situation of having found this course, and you can hope. 
    Don't hesitate! Begin! And have a little fun, too!</p>
