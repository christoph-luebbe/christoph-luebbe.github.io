    <p>First of all I want to thank Prof. Dr. Jörg Hüfner for the suggestion and invitation 
    to revise my old, proven &quot;Vorkurs&quot; manuscript. The idea was to redesign 
	and reformat it attractively,&nbsp;making it accessible 
    online, or in the form of the new medium of CD-ROM, to a larger number of 
    interested people (before, during and after the actual preparation course). 
    Thank you for many discussions including detailed questions, tips or formulations, and last not least for the continuous encouragement 
    during the long labor on a project full of vicissitudes.</p>

    <p>Then my special thanks go to Prof. Dr. Hans-Joachim Nastold who 
    helped and encouraged me&nbsp;by answering a 
    couple of mathematical questions nearly 50 years ago when I - coming from a 
    law oriented home and a 
     
    grammar school concentrating on classical languages, without knowing any 
    scientist and lacking any access to mathematical textbooks or to a library, and 
	confronted with two 
    young brilliant mathematics lecturers - was in a similar, but even more 
    hopeless situation than you could possibly be in now. At that time I decided to 
	someday do something really effective to reduce the math shock, if not to 
    overcome it, if I survived this shock myself.</p>

    <p>Prof. Dr. Dieter Heermann deserves my thanks for his competent advice, 
    his influential support and active aid in an early stage of the 
    project. I thank Dr. Thomas Fuhrmann cordially for his enthusiasm for the 
    multimedia ideas, the first work on the electronic conversion of the 
    manuscript, for the programming of the three Java applets, and in particular 
    for the function plotter. To his wife Dr. Andrea Schafferhans-Fuhrmann I 
    owe the correction of a detail important for the users 
    of the plotter.</p>

    <p>I also have to thank the following members of the Institute for numerous 
    discussions, suggestions and help, especially Prof. F. Wegner for the attentive 
    correction of the last chapters of the Word script in an early stage, Dr. E. Thommes 
    for exceptionally careful aid during the error location in the HTML text, 
    Prof. W. Wetzel for tireless advice and inestimable help in all sorts of 
    computer questions, Dr. Peter John for relief with some illustrations, Mr. Ting 
    Wang for computational assistance and many other members of the Institute 
    for occasional support and ongoing encouragement.</p>

    <p>My main thanks go to my immediate staff: firstly to Mrs. Melanie Steiert 
    and then particularly to Mrs. Dipl.-Math. Katharina Schmock for the 
     excellent transcription of the text into LATEX, Mrs. Birgitta Schiedt and 
    Mr. Bernhard Zielbauer for their enthusiasm and skill in transferring the 
    TEX formulae into the HTML version and finally to Olsen 
    Technologies for the conception of the navigation and the fine 
    organization&nbsp;of the HTML version. To the board of directors of the 
    Institute, in particular Prof. C. Wetterich and Prof. F. Wegner, I owe a 
    great dept of gratitude for providing the funds for this team in 
    the decisive stage.</p>

    <p>Furthermore I would like to thank the large number of interested students 
    over the years who, through their rousing collaboration and their questions 
    during the course, or via even later feedback, have contributed decisively to the 
    quality and optimization of the compact form of my lecture script 
    &quot;Mathematical Methods of Physicists&quot; of which the &quot;Vorkurs&quot; is the first 
    part. As a representative of the many whose faces and voices I remember better than 
    their names I want to name Björn Seidel. Many thanks also to all those users 
    of the online course who spared no effort in reporting actual transference 
    problems, or remaining typing and other errors&nbsp;to me, and thus helped 
    me to asymptotically approach the ideal of a faultless text. My thanks go also 
    to Prof. Dr. rer.nat.habil. L. Paditz for critical hints and suggestions for 
    changes of the limits for the arguments of complex numbers.
    </p>

    <p>My thanks especially go to my former student tutors Peter Nalbach, Rainer Tafelmayer, Steffen Weinstock and Carola von Saldern 
	for their help in welcoming the beginners from near and far cheerfully, and 
	motivating and encouraging them. They raised the course above the dull 
	routine of everyday and helped to make it an experience which one may 
	remember with pleasure even years later.</p>

    <p>Finally I am full of sincere gratitude to my three children and my 
    son-in-law Christoph Lübbe. Without their perpetual encouragement and 
	untiring help at all times of the day or night I never would have been been able to get so deeply into the 
    world of modern media. To them and to my grandchildren I want to dedicate this 
    future-oriented project:

    <p align="justify">After the online course resulted in a doubling of the 
    number of German speaking beginners at the physics faculty in Heidelberg 
    within two years, an English version was suggested by Prof. Dr. Karlheinz Meier. 
	I am deeply grateful to cand. phil. transl. Aleksandra Ewa Dastych for her very 
	careful, patient 
    and indispensable help in composing this English version. Also I owe thanks to Prof. K.&nbsp; Meier, Prof. Dr. J. Kornelius and Mr. Andrew Jenkins, B.A. for managing  contact to her. My 
    thanks go also to the directors of the Institute, Prof. Dr. C. Wetterich and 
    Prof. Dr. O. Nachtmann, for providing financial support for this task.

    </p>
	<p align="justify">Last but not least, many special thanks go to my friend Prof. Dr. 
	Alfred Actor (from Pennsylvania State University) for a very careful and critical 
	expert reading of the English translation.<br />
