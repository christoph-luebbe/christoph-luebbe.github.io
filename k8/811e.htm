    <span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">we decided, 
    mainly for fundamental and mathematical reasons, to use the </span>&nbsp;<em>field 
    of real numbers </em>&nbsp;as the basis of our physical considerations,
    <span style="font-family: Arial" lang="en-us">al</span><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">though 
    the finite precision of all physical measurements would have allowed us to 
	use only the rational numbers. In this chapter, we want 
    to once more extend the field of numbers without any compelling physical need, 
    namely to the </span>&nbsp;<em>complex numbers</em>

    <p><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">Although there 
    are many mathematical reasons to extend the field of numbers so that it 
    contains also the solution of the equation&nbsp;</span>

    extension many unexpected and deep insights become possible, the complex 
    numbers are for physics only a typical<b> </b></span> <em>tool</em>. 
    <span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">At no point in 
    physics there is a true need to use complex numbers. Nevertheless they are a 
    very convenient way to describe various phenomena in many areas of physics. 
    You can not yet imagine how convenient something unnecessary may be! 
    Complex numbers are not only helpful everyday tools for all oscillation 
    processes, and the wide field of electrical engineering, but also especially 
    quantum mechanics makes heavy use of complex quantities. The decisive 
    difference between the Schr√∂dinger equation and the heat conduction equation is 
    the imaginary unit</span> "<img src="eq/i.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="4" height="11" />". 
    <span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">Without the use of 
    complex numbers we would have to deal with two complicated coupled 
    real differential equations instead of solving a single simple complex one. Therefore, this chapter is also a direct preparation for your lecture on 
    quantum mechanics.</span></p>

    <p><span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">The surprising 
    results of complex numbers in mathematics are interesting in themselves and 
    well worth the effort:&nbsp;with the extension from </span> 
    <img src="eq/mr.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="12" height="11" /> 
    to 
    <img src="eq/mc.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="11" height="13" /> 
    not only 
    <img src="k8/gif/f81101.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="57" height="15" />becomes 
    solvable, <span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">but every 
    equation of second degree. And every algebraic equation of&nbsp;</span><img src="eq/n.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="9" height="8" />-th

    <span lang="EN" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">Each&nbsp;rational 
    function has an expansion into partial fractions
    . Only 
    now does the convergence radius of power series become understandable from the 
    definition domain, and a lot of other things besides.</span></p>
