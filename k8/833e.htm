    <h4>8.3.3 Graphic Illustration</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="c2">
    <p>Unfortunately, the <em>graphic illustration </em>of complex functions 
	turns out to be significantly more difficult than in the real case, since a 
    complex function 
	correlates <em>four&nbsp;real quantities</em>. Instead of mapping one real pre-image straight line, namely the&nbsp;x-axis, onto an other 
    one, the image 
    straight line or y-axis, we now have to map the complete pre-image complex plane, 
	the z-plane, onto another one, the&nbsp; image or w-plane.&nbsp;In the graphic 
	illustration of a real function of a real variable, we have become 
    used to placing the pre-image and image number lines orthogonal to one 
	another and illustrating the mapping by means of a curve in this plane. </p>

    <p>For complex functions of a complex variable, we have to find new ways of 
    illustration. Mostly we will use the <em>pre-image plane and the image plane</em> 
	<a href="#833b1e">drawn side by side</a> and characterize selected points or 
	curves in the z-plane and their&nbsp;images in the&nbsp; w-plane by using the 
    same symbols or colours.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>Furthermore, a&nbsp; <a href="#833b2e" >net of level 
    curves</a> of the 
	<em>real part u and imaginary part v over the z-plane</em> or <em>of 
	the absolute value <img src="k8/gif/f83301.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="18" height="24" /> 
	and the argument <img src="k8/gif/f83302.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="37" height="18" /> 
	of the functional values over an xy-net of&nbsp; the z-plane</em> can give 
	us a more exact idea of the mapping. </p>

    <p>The best impression of the effect of a function we get through a&nbsp; <em>perspective</em>
    <a href="#833b3e">r</a><a href="#833b3e" >elief of 
    mountains</a> for example with a&nbsp; xy-net over a certain range of the&nbsp;z-plane.</p>

    <p>Because of these difficulties, we shall study only the most important 
	functions chosen from our basis of real functions in the complex field:</p>
