  <p class="c1">Number Sphere</p>

  <p>Finally we mention an alternative to the representation of the complex 
	numbers in the Gauss number plane: the <em>Riemann number sphere</em>:</p>

  <p>In order to do this we imagine a sphere of diameter 1 positioned with its South 
	Pole touching the origin of the Gauss plane, and all points of the plane 
	connected by straight lines with the North Pole of the sphere, as 
	sketched in the following figure:</p>

  <p><img src="k8/gif/b8162.gif" alt="math formula" /><br clear="all" />
  <span class="bild">Figure 8.3:</span> Riemann number sphere on&nbsp; top of 
	the Gauss plane</p>

  <p>By means of this &quot;stereographic projection&quot; (as it is called by 
	mathematicians) each point of the plane is unambiguously assigned to one point 
	on the surface of the sphere which can serve as alternative representative for the corresponding 
	complex number: You see immediately that the origin is mapped onto the 
	&quot;South Pole&quot;, the interior of the unit circle onto the &quot;southern 
	hemisphere&quot;, the unit circle onto the &quot;equator&quot; and the region outside the 
	unit circle onto the &quot;northern hemisphere&quot;. The most interesting feature of 
	this illustration, however, is the &quot;North Pole&quot; which turns out to 
	be the 
	continuous image of all infinitely far-off points of the plane. This 
	expresses the fact that from the viewpoint of complex numbers there exists 
	only one &quot;number&quot;<img src="eq/inf.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" /> 
	and that in its neighbourhood the same arguments go through as for 
	every other complex number. At some later time in your studies you will 
	return to this representation and consider the neighbourhood of the point <img src="eq/inf.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" /> 
	on the Riemann sphere. We will not further use it in this course.</p>
