  <p class="c1">Standard units:</p>

  <p>What can be used as a standard unit? - The answers to this question have changed 
  greatly through the centuries. Originally people everywhere used easily available 
  comparative quantities like cubit or foot as units of length, and the human pulse 
  beat as unit of time. (The Latin word tempora initially 
  meant temple!) But not every foot has equal length, and the pulse can beat more 
  quickly or slowly. Alone in Germany there have been more than 100 different 
  cubit and foot units in use.</p>

  <p>Therefore, since 1795 people referred to the ten millionth part of the 
	earth meridian quadrant as the &quot;meter&quot;, and represented this 
	length by the well-known rod 
  made out of an alloy of platinum and iridium. The 
  measurement of time was referred to the earth's rotation: for a long time the second was  defined as the 86400th part of an average solar day.</p>

  <p>In the meantime more exact atomic standards have been introduced: One meter 
	is now the distance light travels within the 1/299 792 485 part of a second. 
	One second is now defined in terms of the period of a certain oscillation of cesium 
  133 atoms in &quot;atomic clocks&quot;. Perhaps some day  these 
  standards will also be improved.</p>
