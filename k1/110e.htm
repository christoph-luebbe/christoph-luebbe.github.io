    <p><span lang="EN">All scientific insight begins when a 
	curious and attentive person wonders about some phenomenon, and begins a 
	detailed qualitative observation of this aspect of nature. This observing process then 
	can become 
    more and more quantitative, the object of interest increasingly idealized, until it becomes an 
    experiment asking a well-defined question. The answers to this experiment, the measured 
    data, are organized into tables, and can be graphically visualized in diagram 
	form to facilitate the search for correlations and dependencies. After 
	calculating or estimating the precision of the measurement, the so-called experimental 
	error, one can interpolate and search 
    for a</span> <span lang="EN"><em>description or at least an approximation in 
	terms of 
    known mathematical curves or formulae</em>. From such empirical connections, 
    conformities to known laws may be discovered. These are mostly formulated in 
    mathematical language (e.g. as differential equations). Once one has found such 
    a connection, one wants to &quot;understand&quot; it. This means either one finds a 
    theory (e.g. some known physical laws) from which one can derive the 
    experimentally obtained data, or one tries using a &quot;hypothesis&quot; to guess the 
    equation which underlies the phenomenon. Obviously also for doing this task a lot of 
    mathematics is necessary. Finally mathematics is needed once again to make 
    predictions which are intended to be checked against experiments, and so on. In such 
    an upward spiral science is progressing.</span></p>
