	<p>Direct mathematical study of sequences and series are, for natural scientists, 
	less 
	important than the fact that they greatly help us to understand and perform 
	the limiting procedures which are of fundamental importance in  physics. For this reason, we have combined in this 
    chapter the most important facts of this part of mathematics. Later you will 
    deal in greater detail with these things in your future mathematics lectures. </p>
