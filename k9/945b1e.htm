  <p>In our considerations concerning transformations we have always been 
	asking 
	only the question of, how the components of a fixed vector would look like, if 
	we had changed the describing coordinate system or rather the basis vectors. 
	Then the same vector
	<img src="eq/avekt.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="9" height="13" /> 
	will be represented with respect to the two different <em>orthonormal bases</em> 
  <img src="eq/evekt_k.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="13" height="25" /> 
	rather 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94512.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="13" height="33" /> 
	by different components 
  <img src="eq/a_k.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="14" height="17" /> 
	and 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94513.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="14" height="24" />,respectively: 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94514.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="112" height="33" />. 
	If in this case 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94515.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="102" height="34" /> 
	for instance 
	would be rotated around the 3-axis by an angle
	<img src="eq/phi.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="10" height="17" />clockwise 
	looking in positive 3-direction, the components
	<img src="k9/gif/f94516.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="104" height="34" />would 
	rotate correspondingly, as we have seen. This situation is called the
	<em>passive viewpoint</em> and we will take this viewpoint consequently 
	during the whole course. This problem is of great importance because 
	physicists have to make sure that their laws are formulated in such a 
	manner that they are independent of the chosen coordinate system.</p>

  <p>Physicists have, however, in addition another, at first sight <em>fully 
	different problem,</em> namely the mathematical description of mass points, 
	vectors, etc. which really move in space (e.g. with time) for instance 
	rotate. In this case we have to describe the original vector
	<img src="eq/avekt.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="9" height="13" /> 
	and the physical vector
	<img src="k9/gif/f94517.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="9" height="17" />, 
	which was e.g. rotated around the 3-axis by an angle
	<img src="eq/phi.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="10" height="17" />clockwise 
	looking in positive 3-direction, in one and the same 
	coordinate system
	<img src="eq/evekt_k.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="13" height="25" />: 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94518.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="59" height="25" /> und 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94519.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="59" height="33" />. 
	This situation is called the <em>active viewpoint.</em> The following figure 
	shows you that in this case holds 
  <img src="k9/gif/f94520.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="116" height="34" />.</p>

  <div class="c2">
    <p><img src="k9/gif/b94515e.gif" alt="math formula" width="652" height="258" /><br clear="all" />
    <span class="bild">Figure 9.15: Difference between passive and active 
	viewpoint</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>In both cases we have intentionally used the hat to label the new 
	components to signalize clearly that the relation</p>

  <div class="c2">
    <p>
    <img src="k9/gif/f94516.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="104" height="34" /></p>
  </div>

  <p>may have two fully different meanings, namely:</p>

  <div class="c3">
    <p>1. the transformed components of a vector
    <img src="eq/avekt.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="bottom" width="9" height="13" /> as 
	linear combination of the old ones in case of a rotation of the coordinate 
	system by an angle 
    <img src="eq/phi.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="10" height="17" /> 
	around the 3-direction and</p>

    <p>2. the components of a vector after its rotation by an angle 
    <img src="k9/gif/f94522.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" width="22" height="17" /> 
	around the 3-direction as linear combination of its components before the 
	rotation.</p>
  </div>If you have clarified both situations only once, there is scarcely any danger 
	of confusion, but rather pleasure about the fact that you are able to solve 
	two problems at once by studying the same rotation matrices.<p>
