    <p>Because there are two different kinds of products for any two 
vectors, there are also several multiple products involving three and more 
	vectors. <em>Four</em> of these multiple products occur in 
physical problems, and we want to discuss them in this section. 
We study first the characteristics of two kinds of products of <em>three</em> 
	vectors and then 
    two different products of <em>four</em> vectors. We reduce each of these more 
complicated products to the computation of scalar and simple vector products 
    alone:</p>
