We would like to remind you once more of the fact that the right side of this equation 
contains - according to the Einstein convention - three sums over 
    <img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96904.gif" width="68" height="24">, 
    <img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96905.gif" width="65" height="24">, 
    and 
    <img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96906.gif" width="73" height="23">.&nbsp; 
	Thus there are altogether 27 
    summands, of which&nbsp; 21 we do not need to be afraid of, because 
we know that they vanish. Only the following six terms remain non-zero, three
	of them with the characteristic minus signs:<div class="c2">
      &nbsp;<p>
      <img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96909.gif" width="422" height="39">
    </div>&nbsp;<p>Here the six summands are organized 
according to basis vectors, to be able to recognize more 
easily that e.g.: the 1-component of the product vector is constructed from 
components of the two factors as follows: 
<img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96910.gif" width="165" height="39">.&nbsp; 
Generally for the m-th component we get:</p>

    <div class="c2">
      <img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96911.gif" width="475" height="39">

.
    </div><br>
    The final way of writing is justified because of the cyclic permutability of the indices 
    in the Levi-Civita symbol.<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Our representation of the Levi-Civita symbol as 
    a determinant of Kronecker symbols permits even more ways of writing down the component representation of the vector product. 
	These can 
easily be kept in mind and may be known to some of you :</p>

    <div class="c2">
      <img align="middle" hspace="5" alt="math formula" src="k9/gif/f96912.gif" width="551" height="68">
    </div><br>
In order to obtain the final form in the preceding determinant, the lines were cyclically 
    permuted. In this manner or e.g. by reflection of the determinant in its main 
    diagonal, you
can find again a whole set of representations which are all 
equivalent, since they lead to the same result. In  
practice you will naturally pay attention to existing zeros and select that 
form, from which you can see the desired result immediately.<br>
    In the last two forms the determinant way of writing is clearly meant 
symbolically and to be enjoyed with some caution, because, as you see, the
basis vectors stand as elements in the determinant, and an object of this kind 
    has actually not been defined. The meaning of this determinant is an easily remembered 
	expression for the 
following frequently used development with respect to the adjuncts:<p>&nbsp;</p>
