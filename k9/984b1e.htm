    <p>The German <b>PDF version</b> of this course (without animations and the solutions 
	for 
	the exercises) may be printed from the internet as a <em>script</em> (e.g. to 
	be taken to the beach). An English PDF version is in preparation. In addition there is a German <b>book 
	edition</b> of the course available in book stores with most figures 
	in black and white which clearly can not contain the animations and the 
	function plotter, but which includes solutions of the exercises in an appendix. </p>

    <p>Naturally the content of the relevant literature goes far beyond 
	what we have discussed here. In order to avoid anticipation of things 
	which may be in your future lectures we deliberately do not recommend 
	individual textbooks. However, 
	you will find below a list in <em>
	alphabetical order </em>suggesting a variety of newer 
	and older textbooks 
	waiting for you in libraries. This list is presented without comment to avoid 
	chaneling your enthusiasm and to 
	make it easier for you to maintain an overview when immersing yourselves in 
	books during the upcoming time. </p>
	<p>Before buying a book you should have looked 
	into it several times &quot;successfully&quot;.</p>
