  <div class="c2">
    <p>We now have a commutative product of two vectors. Granted, it is only a scalar one 
	lacking associative law and a unique inverse. But 
    it does provide a 
simple and compact characterization of the orthonormality of our basis
vectors and, above all, a reasonable and appropriate description of all 
the many physical situations in which the projection of one vector onto another plays an important role .</p>

    <p>However, we cannot settle for just this. First of all we want to at least try to find a 
    genuine vector product which assigns to two vectors again an 
element of the vector space. Secondly we want a nice simple 
    expression of the fact that our basis vectors form a 
right-handed coordinate system. Finally we know a whole crowd of vector-like 
    quantities in physics which cannot be brought so simply in connection with 
	displacements for instance angular momentum and torque - but have very much 
	to do with rotations of extended rigid bodies around an axis. The existence 
    of a vector product the scalar product is, by the way, a special characteristic 
of the three-dimensional space; for vectors in

    does not exist.</p>
