    <h4>9.6.11 No Associative Law</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="c2">
    <p>Although we have now a genuine vector product which can be multiplied 
	again vectorially by a third vector, <em>no Associative Law </em>holds true, 
	as we also found in the case of the scalar product.</p>
    <br />
    We show this in the simplest manner by a single counter-example using our 
	basis vectors: On the one hand applies: <img src="k9/gif/f961101.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" /> 
	and on the other hand: <img src="k9/gif/f961102.gif" alt="math formula" hspace="5" align="middle" />.<br />
    <br />

    <p>Thus, no Associative Law can apply. What, however, takes its place? 
	We will deal with this question among other things in the next section.</p>
