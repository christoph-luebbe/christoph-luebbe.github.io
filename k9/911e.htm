    After we have dealt with functions of real variables and their analysis as 
    well as with the simplest arithmetic rules of complex numbers, we turn 
    in the last chapter of this course to the three-dimensional space in which 
    we live and in which all of physics happens.</span></p>

    We all have a good visualization of three-dimensional space from our 
    everyday experience. Typically we think of a room or a box with length, width 
    and height in which one can place three perpendicular rulers, one measuring 
	length, one measuring width and one height. The position for instance of the upper right front corner of your keyboard can 
    be chosen to be the intersection point of the three rulers. Mathematicians construct<b> the three-dimensional 
    real space</b> </span>
